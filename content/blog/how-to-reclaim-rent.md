# How to Reclaim Rent from Empty Solana Token Accounts

If you've been using Solana for a while, you've likely accumulated empty token accounts that are locking up your SOL as rent. This guide will show you how to reclaim that SOL using Manage Solana's Rent Finder tool.

## What is Rent in Solana?

In Solana, every account requires a minimum balance (rent) to exist on-chain. When you receive tokens or NFTs, new accounts are created, and SOL is locked as rent. If these accounts become empty, the rent is still locked until you explicitly close them.

## Why Reclaim Rent?

- **Free Up SOL**: Recover SOL that's currently locked and unusable
- **Clean Your Wallet**: Remove empty accounts cluttering your wallet
- **Save Money**: Every SOL counts, especially with small balances

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open Manage Solana

Launch the app via Telegram or visit [managesolana.com](https://www.managesolana.com).

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

Click "Connect Wallet" and select your wallet provider:
- Phantom
- Solflare
- Backpack

### Step 3: Navigate to Rent Finder

From the dashboard, click on **"The Rent Finder"** card.

### Step 4: Scan Your Wallet

The app will automatically scan your wallet for empty token accounts. This may take a few seconds.

### Step 5: Review Found Accounts

You'll see a list of empty accounts with:
- Account address
- Amount of SOL locked (rent)
- Total recoverable amount

### Step 6: Select Accounts to Close

- Review the list carefully
- Select which accounts you want to close
- Or select all for maximum recovery

### Step 7: Review Transaction

Before confirming, review:
- Total SOL to be reclaimed
- Transaction fee (15% of reclaimed rent)
- Net amount you'll receive

### Step 8: Sign Transaction

Approve the transaction in your wallet. The operation is atomic, meaning all accounts close together or none do.

### Step 9: Receive Your SOL

Once confirmed, the reclaimed SOL (minus fees) will be in your wallet!

## Tips for Maximum Recovery

1. **Regular Scans**: Check your wallet periodically for new empty accounts
2. **Batch Operations**: Close multiple accounts in one transaction to save on fees
3. **Verify First**: Always review the accounts before closing

## Safety & Security

- ✅ All transactions are atomic (all or nothing)
- ✅ You review every account before closing
- ✅ We never access your private keys
- ✅ Transparent fee structure

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this affect my active token accounts?**  
A: No, only empty accounts are closed. Active accounts with balances are never touched.

**Q: How much does it cost?**  
A: We charge 15% of the reclaimed rent as a fee. The remaining 85% goes to you.

**Q: Is it safe?**  
A: Yes! All operations are transparent and atomic. You review everything before signing.

## Conclusion

Reclaiming rent from empty token accounts is a simple way to free up locked SOL. With Manage Solana's Rent Finder, the process is quick, safe, and transparent.

# Welcome to Manage Solana

We're excited to introduce **Manage Solana**, your all-in-one toolkit for managing your Solana wallet efficiently and securely.

## What is Manage Solana?

Manage Solana is a comprehensive Telegram Mini App and web application designed to help Solana users:

- **Reclaim Rent**: Find and recover SOL locked in empty token accounts
- **Burn Spam**: Remove unwanted NFTs and dust tokens while reclaiming rent
- **Collect Loose Change**: Batch swap small token balances into SOL
- **Revoke Permissions**: Safely remove risky token approvals

## Why We Built This

Managing a Solana wallet can be tedious. Empty token accounts lock up SOL as rent, spam NFTs clutter your wallet, and small token balances are hard to manage. We built Manage Solana to solve these problems in one place.

## Key Features

- **Web Version**: Full-featured desktop experience
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works seamlessly on all devices

### 💰 Cost Effective
